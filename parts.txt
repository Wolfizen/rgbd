It also helps to have some single-pin connectors. If you use the 3-pin connectors, cut the cables for the other pins, or you'll probably fry a pi (like I did. Its efforts shall not be forgotten).

I wired DIN (green, middle channel) to GPIO 10 (pin 19) [https://pinout.xyz/pinout/pin19_gpio10#].

I wired my ground to one of the grounds on the pi. It doesn't matter which.

I connected the spliced wires on my strip to the screw connectors on my power supply.

The extra JST-SM connectors are so that you can cut the strip and solder the connectors on (and is the whole point around the "zones" in my code).
