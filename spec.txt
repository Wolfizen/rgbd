The base product is just a python script that will read from a config.json file and control the strip based off of that appropriately.

Base product reqs:
* reading config.json
* setting "zones" of different lengths/patterns on one strip
* different animation support
* controlling groups of zones as one zone (i.e. 3 zones each treated as an individual LED, and solid)
* fading colors, and the math to go with that

Light controller should be a daemon that's controllable over dbus.
